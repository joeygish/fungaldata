Using datasets to predict which mushrooms to pick and when.

Will be initially pulling data from iNaturalist to create models for the PNW region which will predict the optimum time to go mushroom picking. Undoubtedly, analysis will reveal what we already know (i.e. go pick mushrooms when it rains in the fall). However, it will be interesting to see how quality the data is and to pick up on surprising trends.

Goals are that anyone can use the code written to analyse a csv file with columns showing the latitutide and longitude of the harvest, the date in format MM-DD-YYYY, and the species name.
